**Hello!** This blog is a place to publish news and ideas about [oldinsurancemaps.net](https://oldinsurancemaps.net), the platform at the heart of my masters thesis at LSU, ["Creating a Public Space for Georeferencing Sanborn Maps"](https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_theses/5641). I have long been a superfan of Sanborn maps, so the project is as much a love letter to them as anything else.

## A little bit of context

There were two original motivations for this endeavor:

- Create a platform for collaborative map georeferencing
- Provide greater access to existing online map archives

Neither of these ideas is new, but I was especially inspired by the idea of the _archival commons_ and wanted to build something with elements of that model in mind&mdash;open access, public curation, and extensibility[^1] [^2]. The wealth of available open source geospatial software offers so much to work with, and I wanted to try some of it out on this idea.

I decided to build around the Library of Congress [Sanborn map collection](https://loc.gov/collections/sanborn-maps) because

- It is huge (35k volumes, 500,000 sheets)
- The scans are color and generally high quality
- All the maps are in the public domain (I triple-checked this)
- It has a good [JSON API](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/)

Really, there is nothing not to love. Most importantly, focusing on the collection as a whole meant I was making a replicable template for any edition. So while it was exciting to see people georeference [New Orleans](https://oldinsurancemaps.net/viewer/new-orleans-la), it was more compelling to me to see people work on places like [New Iberia](https://oldinsurancemaps.net/viewer/new-iberia-la) or [Plaquemine](https://oldinsurancemaps.net/viewer/plaquemine-la). Small towns likely lack the resources for digital initiatives like this, so, in a way, this whole platform is built just for them. You can now explore [138 different towns](https://oldinsurancemaps.net/browse) across Louisiana as they looked around the turn of the 20th century.

## Looking ahead from here

Turns out, this is a really hard project to put down&mdash;I keep acting like I have free time to spend on it. At the moment, I'm in the midst of a significant redesign of the platform (more on that later), and hope to have it fully functional (i.e. better than ever) by early December. Stay tuned!

In the meantime, here are a few presentations I have given over the course of working on the project:

- very early technical ideas: [GeoNode Virtual Summit - Dec. 2020](https://summit.geonode.org/schedule/#session-110) ([slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSwbTO3jKrwGFKwouZdPSWfQVB3sws8I7bdH_CiSoNTt3l3wefu3s50NAxXn4N7M9CkW09hf9xZh63j/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000))
- midway through the design: [NACIS - Oklahoma City - Oct. 2021](https://nacis2021.sched.com/event/lXOu/cartographic-resources) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7agzL4G5q8), [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10khtmm8TOkZpsWNo-Yfvip4HqXHhwrPycIJYsBg1mA4/edit?usp=sharing))
- begining of pilot project: [Geo4Lib Camp - Feb. 2022](https://geo4libcamp.github.io/) ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXnzZ8MkDXo&list=PL6aDid_9TtzUI7_bPoulDphsF4Bfp8AOj&index=6))
