# Platform Architecture

:::caution Under development...

If you are looking for installation documentation, see the README at [ohmg-dev/OldInsuranceMaps](https://github.com/ohmg-dev/OldInsuranceMaps).
:::

OHMG is a Django app that relies on a handful of non-Django components as well:

- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) + [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) - frontend framework and map interfaces
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com) + [Celery](https://celeryq.dev) - background processing queue
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) + [PostGIS](https://postgis.net) - spatial database for GCPs, etc.
- [TiTiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler) - dynamic raster tiler for georeferenced maps



## The Georeference App

This app is designed as a standalone GeoNode extension. In theory, anyone could install it within their own GeoNode installation, independent of the LOC app described below (please [open a ticket](https://github.com/mradamcox/loc-insurancemaps/issues) if you are interested in doing so).

This app facilitates the actual georeferencing process, i.e. it allows users to georeference Documents in the GeoNode CMS, turning them into raster Layers (GeoTIFFs). It consists of three user-accessible tool interfaces, as well as a new summary tab in the Layer and Document detail pages. A quick summary of these tools follows, but more detailed documentation on how to use each one can be found in the [Georeferencing Process](/docs/making-the-mosaics/overview) section.

### Georeferencing in Stages

One central strategy is a predetermined set of GeoNode "thesaurus keywords" that are assigned to resources during the georeferencing process to keep track of their status along the way. These keywords will be highlighted in bold below, to illustrate the progression. To begin georeferencing any uploaded Document, one need only assign it the **unprepared** keyword.

#### Split

```python
/split/<document_id>		# the splitting interface for a Document
```

![The interface for the splitting tool.](../../static/img/split-interface.png)

This interface allows users to "split" a document into smaller pieces, which is necessary if the scanned image has two different maps on it (because each must be georeferenced separately). More generally, this process could be called "Preparation."

While the splitting process is running in the background, the keyword **splitting** is assigned. When the process is complete, the Document that has been split is flagged as `metadata_only` so it no longer appears in search results, and it is assigned the **split** keyword. New documents resulting from the split are marked as **prepared**.

If a document does not need to be split, this evaluation can be recorded and it will be marked as **prepared**, i.e. ready to be georeferenced.

#### Georeference

```python
/georeference/<document_id>	# the georeferencing interface for a Document
```

![The georeferencing interface.](../../static/img/georeference-interface.png)

The "georeference" interface allows users to create ground control points (GCPs) which are then sent to a backend process and used to warp the document. During the warping process, the Document is assigned the **georeferencing** keyword. Upon completion, a new Layer is created in Geoserver (a GeoTIFF) and registered in Geonode. The Document and Layer are both assigned the keyword **georeferenced**.

### Overview tab

In the Document detail and Layer detail pages a new tab is added labeled **Georeference**. This tab provides a summary of all the georeferencing actions that have been performed on that Document or Layer. You can also access the next step in the georeferencing process for the resource from this tab.

### Search result links

In the search results pages, a list of links are added to each item, allowing quick access to any of the above pages. Only links to actions that are appropriate for that item's georeferencing progress are active.

----

All interfaces are written using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). [Mapserver](https://mapserver.org) is used to generate the WMS preview used during georeferencing from a VRT that is dynamically updated with ground control points.

!!! note
    Earlier iterations of this app incorporated [IIIF](https://iiif.org) with the intention of building from Bert Spaan's work at [allmaps.org](https://allmaps.org). Remnants of this approach have been moved into a separate app called `iiif_support`, and could be reincorporated in the future.

### Data Model & Procedure

All georeferencing activity is stored in `SessionBase` objects, as implemented through the proxy models `PrepSession`, `GeorefSession`, and `TrimSession`. Each proxy model has its own implementation of a `run()` method which uses the information in the `data` field to perform the appropriate actions.

![Data model for the georeference app.](../../static/img/georeference-data-model-sans-links.png)

#### Narrative Explanation

When a user begins preparing a Document, a new `PrepSession` is created. If the user creates cutlines to split the document, this information is saved in the session's `data` field as JSON and then used to run the splitting action that creates new child documents (the original document is not altered).

When a user begins georeferencing a Document, a new `GeorefSession` is created. When the ground control points have been created and submitted through the interface, they are stored as GeoJSON in the session's `data` field and then used to warp the Document and create a Layer. Finally, they are saved separately as `GCP` objects and aggregated into 1 `GCPGroup` per Document. This facilitates iterative editing of the Document's "canonical" GCPs, while also allowing for the reversion to a past set of GCPs if necessary.

Similarly, a user creates a `TrimSession` when they begin trimming a Layer. The mask polygon is stored in the session's `data` and then pushed to the Layer's canonical `LayerMask` object, and applied as a cropped style in Geoserver.

## The LOC Insurance Maps App

This application creates database models and scaffolding to support the acquisition and management of content from the LOC Sanborn Map collection. On the front end, it provides the following urls:

```python
/						# the home page with branding, etc.
/loc/<volume_doi>		# overall progress page for sheets of a volume
/loc/volumes			# access point to load and explore volumes
```

All interfaces are written using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). A custom GeoNode theme was created as well to manage general color branding, etc.

Icons in this app are by [Alex Muravev](https://thenounproject.com/alex2900/) on the Noun Project.
